<h5>Academic Advise: </h5>
As an academic advisor, I guide students through their academic journey and help them navigate various aspects of their educational experience. This includes assisting students in selecting appropriate courses, understanding degree requirements, and planning their academic trajectory to align with their career goals. I provide support and resources to help students overcome academic challenges, develop study skills, and make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures. I offer guidance on academic policies and procedures, assist with course registration, and refer students to campus resources for additional support when needed. My main aim is to make students/PhD researchers succeed academically and reach their full potential.  

<h5>Learning Advise:</h5>
As a learning advisor, I ensure the consistent provision of individualised support and guidance to students, assisting them in navigating their academic journey effectively. This involves regularly reviewing students' academic progress and maintaining open communication with tutors and student services staff to address any concerns or challenges that may arise. I direct students to relevant support and information resources to enhance their academic experience. I am dedicated to assisting students in developing their e-portfolios, employability skills, and adherence to UK academic practices, while also providing constructive feedback to staff, parents, and sponsors regarding individual students' progress. I prioritise supporting students' health, safety, and overall well-being, while also maintaining accurate and up-to-date records and organizing and analyzing student data for monitoring purposes. Finally, I oversee students' induction, enrollment, and graduation processes to ensure a smooth transition throughout their academic journey.
