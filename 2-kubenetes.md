As an academic advisor, I guide students through their academic journey and help them navigate various aspects of their educational experience. This includes assisting students in selecting appropriate courses, understanding degree requirements, and planning their academic trajectory to align with their career goals. I provide support and resources to help students overcome academic challenges, develop study skills, and make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures. Additionally, I offer guidance on academic policies and procedures, assist with course registration, and refer students to campus resources for additional support when needed. My rmain aim is to make students/PhD researchers succeed academically and reach their full potential.
