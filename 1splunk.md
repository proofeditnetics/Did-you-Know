<hr class="major" />  
I have been a Splunk Consultant, Architect, Tech Lead, and Administrator for 7 years. Splunk is still the most cost effective tool for analysis of large sets of unstructured and semi-structured data.

I have architected, deployed, and administered Splunk installations including
 - single instance environments with Enterprise Security for start up security teams 
 - single instance  to multi site clusters ingesting tens of terabytes a day from versions 6.x -> 
 - Expanding a production Splunk environment from a 10 indexer cluster to two 120 node indexers clusters with 3 Search head clusters, running ITSI and Enterprise Security 
 - Architecting the expansion of a 15/TB a day cluster to accomodate 50TB/Day, with multi site availabilty and able to accomodate 5x user burst capacity.      
 - Performance tuning and installation of of ITSI and Splunk Enterprise Security 


A self service platform like Splunk can become the victim of its own success as its popularity with the organisation grows. I can identify what parts of a Splunk cluster are poorly utilized, and work with customers to optimise data ingestion and queries.   

I have worked with threat detection teams, silicon engineers, software developers, business compliance teams, manufacturing IT departments, network engineers,  AIOps, DevOps, and Secops teams to design and optimise queries and dashboards. 

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/complexquery.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>Complex queries on semistructured used to be a specialty of mine, but more recently I have encouraged the use of observability pipelines to transform unstructured data into structured logs or even metrics. </p>

I am an experienced technical lead and can lead and mentor junior Splunk administrators and developers, as well present roadmaps and budget plans to management.
