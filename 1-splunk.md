I meticulously review content from initial drafts to final copies, focusing on identifying basic proofreading issues such as grammar, typos, and context errors. This includes reviewing final drafts of statements of purpose, PhD research proposals, research articles, and theses for students at the Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD levels, ensuring accuracy, brevity, clarity, and adherence to editorial guidelines. I monitor the consistency of all materials within a designated style and establish guidelines as needed. I handle other essential tasks such as content research, development, and management to ensure the overall quality and coherence of the content. 

1. Proofreading:
The proofreading service meticulously checks for grammatical, punctuation, spelling, typographical, and other errors in your written content. It ensures that your work adheres to high linguistic standards.
2. Editing:
The editing service encompasses all aspects of proofreading while focusing on enhancing the overall clarity and coherence of your writing. It addresses consistency, accuracy, flow of thoughts, structural coherence, and adherence to English logic.

My editing service does not involve generating new content or making substantive additions. Instead, I aim to refine and elevate the original ideas, ensuring they
are expressed fluently and logically within the context of English language conventions.

I am an experienced technical lead and can lead and mentor junior Splunk administrators and developers, as well present roadmaps and budget plans to management.
