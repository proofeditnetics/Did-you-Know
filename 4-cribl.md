Making the most of observability data requires more than one analytics tool.

Observability pipelines, like traditional data warehouse pipelines, provide a way for Observability teams to control and shape data, and manage data coming from cloud and container platforms.

Cribl is the most exciting tool in this space, as it provides the best pathway from legacy SIEM tools to a future where data is readily available at sensible price.
