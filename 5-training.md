The role of a Decolonial AI researcher involves exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with decolonial theory and practices. Decolonial AI researchers critically examine the ways in which AI technologies perpetuate or challenge colonial power structures, biases, and epistemologies. They seek to develop AI systems that are sensitive to diverse cultural perspectives, histories, and knowledge systems, and that promote equity and social justice.

Decolonial AI researchers may engage in various activities, including:

1. Critically analyzing existing AI algorithms, datasets, and technologies to identify and address biases, stereotypes, and colonial legacies embedded within them.
2. Collaborating with diverse communities and stakeholders to understand their needs, concerns, and values regarding AI technology.
3. Developing alternative AI models, approaches, and methodologies that prioritize inclusivity, diversity, and cultural sensitivity.
4. Advocating for policies and practices that promote the ethical and responsible use of AI technology, particularly in marginalized and underrepresented communities.
5. Educating and raising awareness about the implications of AI technology on colonialism, imperialism, and social justice issues.
6. Contributing to interdisciplinary research initiatives that bridge the fields of AI, decolonial studies, critical race theory, and social sciences.

Overall, the role of a Decolonial AI researcher is to challenge dominant narratives and paradigms within the AI field and to work towards creating more equitable, inclusive, and socially responsible AI systems. </p>

Of course as an architect one of those audiences is senior management and finance. I have put together architectural presentations on how Splunk and other tools fit into their strategies. I have also created presentations to teach potential stakeholders about my tools and why they are the right choice.   </p>

As a technical lead a joy of the role is to mentor my more junior colleagues. I'm very easy going and like to build rapport with team members from all walks of life. I always devote time to upskill my team mates and of course learn from them!
