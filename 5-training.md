<p>
My role as a Decolonial AI and digital humanities researcher involves exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with decolonial theory and practices. I examine the ways in which AI technologies perpetuate or challenge colonial power structures, biases, and epistemologies. I aim to develop AI systems that are sensitive to diverse cultural perspectives, histories, and knowledge systems, and that promote equality and social justice. My research challenges dominant narratives and paradigms within the AI field and work towards creating socially responsible AI systems. </p>
