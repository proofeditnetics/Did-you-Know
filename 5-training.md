You can have the best tooling money can buy, but if people are not empowered to use it then you have wasted your money. I love teaching users how to get the most out of tools. 

<span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/trainingslides.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I have created bespoke training courses to target specific users of the Splunk platform. I'm happy doing training sessions one to one or to an audience of hundreds. I can deliver these sessions either in person or remotely depending on the audience. </p>

<p>
Of course as an architect one of those audiences is senior management and finance. I have put together architectural presentations on how Splunk and other tools fit into their strategies. I have also created presentations to teach potential stakeholders about my tools and why they are the right choice.   </p>

As a technical lead a joy of the role is to mentor my more junior colleagues. I'm very easy going and like to build rapport with team members from all walks of life. I always devote time to upskill my team mates and of course learn from them!
