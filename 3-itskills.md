My research interests lie at the intersection of literature, performance, identity, and education, with a particular emphasis on postcolonial and decolonial studies, exploring themes of power, resistance, and cultural identity. 

I delve into the role of narrative performance in shaping individual and collective identities, particularly within African literature and marginalised contexts. I am also dedicated to developing inclusive classroom materials and teaching approaches that promote diversity and equality in education.

My current research delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with decolonial theory and practices. My aim is to scrutinize how AI technologies either perpetuate or challenge colonial power structures, biases, and epistemologies, ultimately contributing to the development of AI systems that are attuned to diverse cultural perspectives, histories, and knowledge, promoting more equal, inclusive, and socially responsible AI systems.

Key research interrests: African, Middle Eastern, Francophone Studies. Post[De]colonialism. Narrative Performance. Cultural Studies. History. Film and Media Studies. Literature. Resistance Literature. Digital Humanities. Decolonial AI. Graffiti and Street Art. Cybersecurity Culture.
