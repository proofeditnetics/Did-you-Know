Before getting into data engineering I was a Systems Administrator. I was responsible for server administration, database administration, basic website building, security tools management, and more. Managing a large on premise  Splunk environment is almost like running a small data center, where hundreds of bare metal servers need to communicate.  
  
This broad skill base not only helps in day to day administration of Splunk, but helps me talk to stakeholders across the IT organization.   

In a perfect world nothing would ever go wrong with our environments, but complex systems inevitably fail. I am highly experienced in debugging Splunk and data pipeline issues. Whether its a configuration issue,  performance problems, memory leaks within applications, or in one memorable instance, a linux kernel memory leak triggered by Systemd -  I have a systematic approach to rapidly solve and remediate problems. Equally important is the post incident follow up. I can lead reporting, documentation, and process modification to help teams learn from and avoid service problems.
