My research interests focus on literature, identity, and education, particularly within the context of postcolonial and decolonial studies. My research delves into the complexities of postcolonial and decolonial literature, exploring themes of power, resistance, and cultural identity. I also examine the role of narrative performance in shaping individual and collective identities, particularly within African literature and other marginalized contexts. Additionally, I am interested in developing inclusive classroom materials and teaching approaches that promote diversity, equity, and representation in education.
